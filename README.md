# Models, Algorithms and Data

This is the repository for the code files of the **Models, Algorithms and Data** lecture at the [Computational Science and Engineering Laboratory](https://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch) ETH Zurich taught by Prof. Dr. Jens H. Walther and Dr. Julija Zavadlav. The lecture covered the following topics

- Modeling Data: Linear Least Squares
- Nonlinear Systems I: Bisection, Newton, Secant Methods
- Nonlinear Systems II: Set of Equations
- Interpolation and Extrapolation: Lagrange Interpolation, Cubic Splines, B-splines, NURBS, Multivariate Interpolation
- Radial Basis Functions
- Learning from Data: Neural Networks
- Numerical Integration: Rectangle, Trapezoidal, Simpsonâ€™s Rule, Richardson and Romberg Integration, Adaptive Quadrature, Monte Carlo
- Bayesian Inference

These topics provide a comprehensive overview of computational techniques and their applications in data analysis, modeling, and machine learning.
    
The repository contains a folder with the code to the problem sets, where all of the theoretical knowledge of the lecture had to be applied.
